# Overview
In this project, I aim to assess the performance of the **BLAST** (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm, a widely-used comparison tool in the field of bioinformatics, particularly for genomic and transcriptomic data analysis. My goal was to understand how does the execution time of the BLAST algorithm vary when different numbers of High-Performance Computing (HPC) threads are being utilised. I subsequently visualized the data and presented my research findings using a graphical representation.

# Project Objectives
BLAST Algorithm Evaluation: We will conduct a detailed evaluation of the BLAST algorithm's performance under varying conditions.

**1. Thread Count Analysis**: Our primary objective is to examine how the execution time of the BLAST algorithm is affected by the number of HPC threads used.

**2. Data Visualization**: We will visualize the data obtained from our experiments to gain insights into the algorithm's behavior and efficiency.

# Key Findings
Upon visualizing the data gathered from our experiments, I have observed the following trends:
- Exponential Improvement: The performance of the BLAST algorithm exhibits an exponential improvement as the number of HPC threads increases.
- Optimal Thread Count: The most significant improvements are observed when increasing the number of threads from 1 to 2. Beyond this point, the rate of improvement becomes less pronounced
